# Flex Landing Page

Landing Page created based on the finishing project from the Flexbox section in The Odin Project. We are building a generic webpage with certain popular layout using mostly flexbox. Other things I might try;

1.  Basic media queries (only if they are needed) for responsive design, as I have seen them come up in some resources and it looks to be quite interesting.
2. Semantic HTML for elements instead of divs
3. Hosting fonts (and maybe in woff2)
4. Progressive enchancment for images
5. Dip my toes with pseudo selectors
